      Thanks for stopping by!</br>
      This is my little space on the web where you can get to know me better.</br>
      There's a lot to cover and it would certainly help if you provided some feedback and let me know what you'd like to hear more of.</br>
      </br>
      Here are some of the more noteworthy projects I've worked on:</br></br>
      <div class="projects">
        <div class="single-project">
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"> Intersection and InLinkUK</span> 
          <div class="content hide">
            <p>
              The InLinkUK project is similar to the LinkNYC project.</br>
              While on the InLinkUK Project, I worked on the backend services, enabling smarter kiosks to operate on any network.</br>
              However, as there were physical limitations (think processing and memory) to the kiosk hardware, we needed to build out an even smarter backend service than we did with the original LinkNYC kiosks. </br>
              This about where I moved from being a consumer of APIs to providing that functionality to others. </br>
              If you're unfamiliar with the project, you should check out <a href="https://www.inlinkuk.com/" target="_blank">InLinkUK</a>!</br>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class="single-project">
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"> Intersection and LinkNYC</span>
            <div class="content hide">
              <p>
                The LinkNYC project provides fast and free WiFi to the people of NYC, as well as free nationwide phone calls.</br>
                At Intersection I provided operational network support for the LinkNYC project and built out reporting tools.</br>
                This was a turning point in my career where I started spending more time with platform APIs and less time on an actual CLI.</br>
                I would've never imagined that as a Network Engineeer I'd be touching API's for networking gear, Solar Winds or even Sales Force!</br>
                However, when you're able to pull exactly the information you need in the format you want, you realize it's time well spent.</br>
                If you'd like to learn more about the project, you should check out <a href="https://www.link.nyc/" target="_blank">LinkNYC</a>!</br>

        <div class="single-project">
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"> OnSIP Cloud Phone System and UCaaS</span>
          <div class="content hide">
            <p>
              OnSIP Cloud Phone System provides business communication services without the commitment of a traditional phone service provider and vendor lock-in.</br>
              OnSIP also provides a robust Unified Communication PaaS, that sports integrations with ZenDesk and Slack, or roll your own with the <a href="https://sipjs.com/" targe="_blank">SIP.js</a> library.</br>
              At OnSIP, I worked with the development team and upstream carriers to enable geographic redundancy.</br>
              Occasionally, I'll also perform deep dives into the carrier's network to figure out what's broken.</br>
              Sometimes they'll fix it, othertimes it's a bit more complex, like <a href="https://www.onsip.com/blog/in-depth-verizon-blocks-sip-traffic-using-alg" target="_blank">Verizon's SIP ALG</a>.</br>
              It's also at OnSIP where I first started tinkering with Python, specifically the Paramiko library, for the purpse of doing some CLI scraping of <a href="https://github.com/daveswork/paramikoScripts" target="_blank">Cisco and Juniper devices</a>. </br>
              Definitely check out <a href="https://www.onsip.com/" target="_blank">OnSIP</a> for your business communication needs.</br>
